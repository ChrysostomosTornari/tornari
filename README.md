Useful scripts for R

This is where I intend to keep any useful code that I have generated in order to make future R Coding easier.

Through my R learning journey I have often referred back to old code in order to progress a current project. As in many aspects of life, the quickest way to get to a goal is often by taking the route that you know best. However, it can be challenging to find scripts and R Markdown documents that are buried in old project folder. Therefore I decided to aggregate any useful functions and scripts that I may have here. I hope to keep these publically available and, if some functions can be grouped together to assist in a particular aspect of work, I would like to pull these together into a package one day.
